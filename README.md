# Human_Emotion_Detection
Project Overview:

This project demonstrates a real-time Emotion Detection system using OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for emotion recognition. The system analyzes human emotions based on facial expressions from an image or video feed. It uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and DeepFace’s pre-trained models to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

OpenCV: For image and video processing, face detection.

DeepFace: For emotion detection through deep learning models.

Haar Cascade Classifier: Used for detecting faces in images/videos.

Matplotlib: For displaying images in Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for development.

How It Works:

Face Detection: OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier detects faces in the image or video.

Emotion Recognition: DeepFace analyzes the detected face to identify emotions such as:
Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful, Neutral.

Real-time Detection: The system can process real-time video streams, detecting faces and predicting emotions in each frame.
