# Human_Emotion_Detection
This project demonstrates a real-time Emotion Detection system using OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for emotion recognition. The system analyzes human emotions based on facial expressions from an image or video feed. It uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and DeepFace’s pre-trained models to identify emotion.
